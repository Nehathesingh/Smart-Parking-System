# Smart-Parking-System
***
## Overview
The Smart Parking Model project aims to develop an efficient parking management system using IoT technologies. The system leverages sensors, microcontrollers, and a web interface to provide real-time information about parking space availability and facilitate easy payment of parking fees.
***
## Introduction
The Smart Parking Model uses IoT technology to monitor and manage parking spaces. The system includes sensors to detect vehicle presence and a web interface for users to check slot availability and make payments.
***
## Components
ESP8266: Microcontroller for communication and data collection.
Ultrasonic Sensors: Used to detect vehicle presence in parking slots.
Jumper Wires: For connecting components.
***
## Code
The code for the project is written in C++ and includes logic for detecting vehicle presence, calculating parking fees, and communicating with the server.
***
## Setup
Hardware: Assemble the ESP8266 microcontroller and ultrasonic sensors as per the circuit diagram.
Software: Upload the provided code to the microcontroller. Set up the web application for monitoring and payment processing.
